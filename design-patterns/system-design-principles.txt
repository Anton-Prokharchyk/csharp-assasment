OOP design principles:

1. Programming on interface level rather then implementation.
2. Encapsulate what changes. Separate pieces of the app which could change from constant parts.
3. Prefer composition over inheritance.
4. High cohesion and low coupling.
5. Classes should be open to exstensions and close to modifications.

OOP design patterns:

1. Strategy
2. Observer
3. Decorator
